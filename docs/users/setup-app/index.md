# Setup App

The SolarNode Setup App allows you to manage SolarNode through a web browser.

To access the Setup App, you need to know the network address of your SolarNode. In many cases you
can try accessing <http://solarnode/>. If that does not work, you need to [find the network address
SolarNode is using](../networking.md#finding-solarnodes-network-address).

Here is an example screen shot of the SolarNode Setup App:

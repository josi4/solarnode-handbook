# Unchanged Datum Filter

The [Unchanged Datum Filter][src] provides a way to discard **entire datum** that have not changed
within a datum stream.

This filter is provided by the [Standard Datum Filters][sdf] plugin.

!!! tip

	See the [Unchanged Property Filter](./unchanged-property.md) for a filter that can discard
	individual unchanging _properties_ within a datum stream.

## Settings

Each filter configuration contains the following overall settings:

| Setting            | Description |
|:-------------------|:------------|
--8<-- "snippets/users/datum-filters/base-filter-settings.md"
| Unchanged Max Seconds | When greater than `0` then the maximum number of seconds to refrain from publishing an unchanged datum within a single datum stream. |
| Property Pattern | A property name [pattern][regex] that limits the properties monitored for changes. Only property names that match this expression will be considered when determining if a datum differs from the previous datum within the datum stream. |

## Settings notes

 * **Unchanged Max Seconds** — Use this setting to ensure a datum is included
   occasionally, even if the datum properties have not changed. Having at least one value per
   hour in a datum stream is recommended. This time period is always relative to the last
   unfiltered property within a given datum stream seen by the filter.
